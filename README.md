### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Project title: Happiness from Teen Years through Middle-Age
+ This project is conducted by [Rishabh Ganesh]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] Teenagers are vastly different from who they were when they were younger. Growing through arguably the most developmental phase of their life, teenagers express a variety of complex emotions. When tracking tens of thousands of happy moments, the moments described by teenagers are dwarfed by those reported by adults. What thoughts and feelings occur during people's happy moments? Does it change as they grow from to teenagers to middle-aged adults?
